# 🏥 Healix - Medical Supplies E-Commerce

💡 **Project Idea**  
A Medical Supplies E-Commerce Website built as a single-page application, where all other sections are displayed as popups within the same page to reduce code repetition and enhance performance.  
We also implemented **Dark Mode** and reusable code blocks to write the least amount of code possible.
